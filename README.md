# Go/Golang Test 1:
Create a program in Go that can read in a JSON file containing three separate lists: nouns, adjectives, and numbers. Then create lists that are specific for each type: nouns, adjectives, and numbers. Next, create a function that can be used to return a random index from a list and use it to get indexes from the prior lists. Lastly, read in `madlib.txt` found below and replace each "(noun)" with a random noun from the noun list, "(adjective)" with a random adjective from the adjective list, and "(number)" with a random number from the number list and output the Madlib into the console with the new changes.



Here is an example JSON: 

	{ "Nouns": [ "an apple," "car," "book," "dog," "house," "sun," "tree," 	"mountain," "ocean," "computer" ], "Numbers": [ 1.5, 3.14, 7, 10.2, 5.5, 2, 	8.7, 4.3, 6.1, 9.9 ], "Adjectives": [ "beautiful," "green," "happy," "small," 	"fast," "old," "bright," "loud," "soft," "brave" ] } 

 

Here is madlib.txt: 

	It was a (adjective) and (adjective) night. For the last (number) nights, the 	(noun) upstairs partied all night long making it impossible for you to sleep.  Finally, you decided to grab your (number) foot long (noun) and marched right on up there to (adjective) -ly tell them what for.
